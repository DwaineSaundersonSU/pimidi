See http://projects.ravelox.com/blog for the reason I'm doing this.

This is a simple RTP midi implementation for NoteOn/NoteOff events from
a $150 ION ION Sound Sessions drum kit through a Raspberry Pi to
Logic Express.

I'm doing this purely for fun and don't expect anyone else to use
it but I'm happy to accept suggestions if you ever come across
this code.
